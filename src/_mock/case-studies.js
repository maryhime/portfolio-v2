    project_overview: [
      "This project involved a complete redesign and rebuild of Virtual Champ Global’s website to improve user experience, modernize the visual design, and better communicate the organization’s global mission.",

      "The goal was to create a user-friendly, responsive, and scalable platform that meets the needs of a diverse international audience.",

    challenges: [
      " The primary goal of VCG’s website revamp was to transform their outdated online presence into a modern, high-converting platform.",

      "The existing site lacked visual appeal, clear user flows, and the ability to effectively engage and convert visitors. The redesign focused on improving usability, aligning with current design standards, and supporting business growth through a more strategic and user-centered experience.",
    ],

    target_audience:
      " The website targets potential clients and business partners seeking professional BPO services. These include decision-makers looking for outsourcing solutions in customer support, virtual assistance, and back-office operations.",

    existing_site:
      "VCG had an existing website, but due to outdated design and limited functionality, they chose to build a completely new site from scratch to better align with their brand and business goals.",

    discovery_questions: [
      "To align the project with the client’s vision and business  goals, I began by sending a structured questionnaire focused on understanding their challenges with the existing website and their expectations for the new one.",
      "The responses provided clarity on key priorities, such as design preferences, functionality needs, and business objectives. This step helped ensure that the redesign would meet client expectations without compromising on user experience.",
      " As part of the questionnaire, I also asked the client to share  three inspiration websites (design pegs) that reflected their desired look and feel. These references were later used to guide both the ideation and design phases, ensuring a visual direction that felt aligned with the brand.",
    ],

    competitor_analysis: 'To understand industry trends and user expectations, I conducted a competitive analysis of leading BPO companies, including  Cloudstaff, Accenture, Penbrothers, etc. I compared their website features, how their menu was laid out, service presentation, CTAs, and UX patterns in a comparison table. This analysis helped identify gaps and opportunities that informed the redesign strategy for VCG.',

    competitor_analysis_cont: 'The table below was mainly for comparing what they show in their navigation menu versus the old VCG website. This helped me understand and get an idea on what to add or remove in the VCG’s main navigation menu.',

    user_persona_1_desc: 'This group includes small business owners, operations managers, and enterprise-level executives.
